 * @class UserServiceFactory

 * which is responsible for managing user-related operations. It ensures that the UserService is instantiated with all necessary
 * dependencies, such as the user repository and logger, which are created using their respective factories.
 *
 * The use of a factory pattern helps to encapsulate the creation logic and dependencies management, promoting a cleaner
 * and more maintainable codebase. This pattern is especially useful in applications where instances need to be created
 * dynamically or with specific configurations.
 *
 * The UserServiceFactory relies on the UserRepositoryFactory to create user repository instances and on the LoggerFactory
 * to create logger instances, ensuring that each UserService has the required dependencies to function correctly.
