 * @class SendGridServiceFactory
 * @description Factory for creating SendGridService instances. This factory pattern encapsulates the instantiation
 * logic for SendGridService, making it easy to manage and maintain. By abstracting the creation process, we can ensure
 * that all instances of SendGridService are created consistently with the necessary configuration.
 *
 * The factory pattern here enhances code maintainability and readability by separating the creation logic of the
 * SendGridService from its usage. This is particularly beneficial in larger codebases where the complexity of
 * initialization can increase. By centralizing the creation process, any changes required for the instantiation can
 * be managed in a single place, reducing the risk of errors and improving code reliability.
 *
 * The use of this factory also aids in unit testing and dependency injection. It provides a single point of control
 * for creating instances, allowing tests to easily mock the creation process and inject dependencies as needed.
 * This can lead to more modular and testable code.
 *
 * @classdesc This factory is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple instances of SendGridService need to be
 * created with varying configurations. It ensures each instance is initialized with the appropriate settings and
 * dependencies, promoting consistency and reducing setup redundancy across the application.

  * @method createSendGridService
  * @description This static method is responsible for creating and returning a new instance of the SendGridService class.

  *
  * The method ensures that the SendGridService instance is properly configured with the required API key, which allows
  * the service to send emails through SendGrid's API. This method promotes modularity and ease of maintenance by
  * encapsulating the creation and configuration logic for the SendGridService. The use of the factory pattern here
  * also supports dependency injection and testing, as it provides a single point of creation for the service instances.
  *
  * By centralizing the creation process, this method also makes it easier to manage changes in the instantiation logic
  * or the dependencies required by SendGridService. This can significantly reduce the overhead of maintaining multiple
  * instantiation points throughout the codebase.
  *
  * Additionally, it enhances code readability and maintainability by providing a clear and consistent way to create
  * instances of SendGridService. This is particularly useful in larger projects where services may be instantiated
  * in various parts of the application.
